        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello everyone! My name is Natalie Hwang and I am a current 2nd year Bachelor of Science Psychology major at University of California, Riverside. My career goal is to become a licensed marriage and family therapist. This path is not too difficult and doesnâ€™t require too much schooling. 
The reason I want to do this as my life long career is because I was adopted when I was 14 months old. I have struggled with the feeling of belonging so I wanted to create a space where people were able to feel like they belonged and I hope that they can find that with me. This experience has been mentally challenging for my life and has caused a ripple in my life where I felt lonely quite often in my life. With this career goal in mind, I plan to help many individuals in their developmental growth. 
I have worked in a brain games center and am currently working in the childhood cognition lab working to identify the child and religion and fantasy connections in early age groups. I work to transcribe videos and audios in the event that we lose our data, we have physical copies of transcriptions to refer to. 
This career path is tricky and I want to be able to possibly work either through private practice or through a psychiatric ward at the hospital. 
Currently I am in Alpha Phi Omega which is a co-ed professional fraternity. We are community service-based organization. I am currently the membership vice president and in the past I was the parliamentarian and the historian. This organization has taught me a lot of leadership growth and I have learned a lot in these positions. I like that our organization is small and tight knit but sometimes I wish there was more of a diversity as to who is a part of the organization. 
As a mentor in two organizations, they are both very different. Although getting ghosted by two of my mentees, I think itâ€™s genuinely so hard to keep track of mentees when I have a lot of school. I am currently taking personality and life span development upper division courses and they are pretty easy so far. Though I am nervous for all of my courses in the upcoming year, I genuinely think I will learn a lot as time goes. I hope that now as a bachelor of science degree, that the required laboratory courses will not be too difficult. I hope that I can thrive in those courses and put my best foot forward when it comes to exams or listening to seminars. Though my career path is in the middle in comparison to maybe business degrees or medical school degrees, I hope that I can still make a good amount of money and be able to learn a lot through my schooling. 
As time goes,  I hope to make my parents proud and learn to be a caring individual within the chaos that is this world. I hope that I can make an impact on peopleâ€™s lives.
